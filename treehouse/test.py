Literally spent an entire afternoon to do this challenge, my brain somehow got them all passed, but I still don't feel like I can manipulate dictionary with ease...

So the way I did my stats challenge is like a workaround where I extracted the teacher's name and their course-numbers, made them into a list, and set the list as the value of the newly-created dict variable: "personal_dict", in which the key is set to a placeholder number starting from 0. Then I used .values() method to extract the two values as lists and append them to a master list.

Previously I had managed to extract the same data from a dict, and I output my "personal_dict" like this: {"Kenneth Love": 2, "Andrew Chalkley": 3}
